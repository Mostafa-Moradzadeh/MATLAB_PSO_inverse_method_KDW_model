# MATLAB_PSO_inverse_method_KDW_model

Here, the MATLAB code for preferential water flow modeling using the KDW model through a particle swarm optimization (PSO) inverse method is shared. Here, we aim to solve the KDW model using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) inverse method. All five MATLAB files should be opened. You need to run the 'psoLIra5' file, and it will prompt you to enter the 'Rainfall duration (hr)' and 'Rainfall intensity (mm.hr-1)'. The hydrographs should be specified in two different Excel files: one for 't' (time) and another for 'u' (water flux).
